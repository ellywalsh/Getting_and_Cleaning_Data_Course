Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial signals in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

The following features were selected from the original data (raw data means and standard deviations were calculated from sensor signals as described in original data set documentation):

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
gravityStd
tBodyAccStd
tBodyAccJerkStd
tBodyGyroStd
tBodyGyroJerkStd

These features (including the x, y, z components of each variable where applicable) were averaged by each of 30 subjects for each of six activities.

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
The complete list of activity names is available in 'activities.txt'
